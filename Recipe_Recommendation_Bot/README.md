## Project Description
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Create a tool that recommends recipes based on ingredients inputted to help you eat better food.
- Scrape over 5000 recipes from All Recipes using python and beautiful soup.
- Create a recipe recommendation system inputting ingredients on hand
- Build a client-facing API and a user-friendly app 

## Datasets to be used

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Create a skeleton plan for Project 2
2. Begin data importing process. 
3. Explore and clean data
4. Start the coding process 
5. Run multiple models
6. Include a wine pairing suggestion automatically based on recipe generated. White or red
6. Deploy a chatbot
7. Final question of end user... "Do you think this recipe was a good recommendation?"

## Results from the Project

- successfully trained and tested the model using keras and tensorflow
    - The model can be improved by using a larger number of images
    - more techniques can be used to improve the model such as 
- successfully deployed the chatbot using the telegram API 
- investigated the use of Amazon lex as a backend to provide a better user experience by using the AWS-API as a backend
